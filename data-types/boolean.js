// The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

// This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

// Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:
// Example 1
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
console.log(isGreater)

// The "null" value
// In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.

// It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

let age = null;
console.log(age);

// The "undfined" value
// The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.

// The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
let age2;
console.log(age2)
